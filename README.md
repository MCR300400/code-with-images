# Code Block Editor

## Overview

The Code Block Editor is a visual tool for creating and managing code blocks. It allows users to construct Python code by dragging and dropping blocks into a workspace. Each block can have dynamic inputs, which users can edit directly. The editor supports adjusting block indentation levels and saving the generated code to a Python file.

## Features

- **Available Blocks**: Click on any block in the sidebar to add it to the main workspace.
- **Selected Blocks**: View and manage the blocks you have selected. Adjust their indentation level using the arrow buttons.
- **Dynamic Inputs**: Edit the values of dynamic inputs within the blocks.
- **Block Removal**: Right-click on a block to remove it from the workspace.
- **Code Saving**: Save the generated code as a Python (.py) file with a user-specified name.
